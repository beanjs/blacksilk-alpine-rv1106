/**
 * DOC: Introduction
 *
 * mac80211 is the Linux stack for 802.11 hardware that implements
 * only partial functionality in hard- or firmware. This document
 * defines the interface between mac80211 and low-level hardware
 * drivers.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Calling mac80211 from interrupts
 *
 * Only ieee80211_tx_status_irqsafe() and ieee80211_rx_irqsafe() can be
 * called in hardware interrupt context. The low-level driver must not call any
 * other functions in hardware interrupt context. If there is a need for such
 * call, the low-level driver should first ACK the interrupt and perform the
 * IEEE 802.11 code call after this, e.g. from a scheduled workqueue or even
 * tasklet function.
 *
 * NOTE: If the driver opts to use the _irqsafe() functions, it may not also
 *	 use the non-IRQ-safe functions!
 */

/**
 * DOC: Warning
 *
 * If you're reading this document and not the header file itself, it will
 * be incomplete because not all documentation has been converted yet.
 */

/**
 * DOC: Frame format
 *
 * As a general rule, when frames are passed between mac80211 and the driver,
 * they start with the IEEE 802.11 header and include the same octets that are
 * sent over the air except for the FCS which should be calculated by the
 * hardware.
 *
 * There are, however, various exceptions to this rule for advanced features:
 *
 * The first exception is for hardware encryption and decryption offload
 * where the IV/ICV may or may not be generated in hardware.
 *
 * Secondly, when the hardware handles fragmentation, the frame handed to
 * the driver from mac80211 is the MSDU, not the MPDU.
 *
 * Finally, for received frames, the driver is able to indicate that it has
 * filled a radiotap header and put that in front of the frame; if it does
 * not do so then mac80211 may add this under certain circumstances.
 */

/**
 * DOC: mac80211 workqueue
 *
 * mac80211 provides its own workqueue for drivers and internal mac80211 use.
 * The workqueue is a single threaded workqueue and can only be accessed by
 * helpers for sanity checking. Drivers must ensure all work added onto the
 * mac80211 workqueue should be cancelled on the driver stop() callback.
 *
 * mac80211 will flushed the workqueue upon interface removal and during
 * suspend.
 *
 * All work performed on the mac80211 workqueue must not acquire the RTNL lock.

 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_HAS_RATE_CONTROL:
 *	The hardware or firmware includes rate control, and cannot be

 *	should be instantiated, and the TX rate reported to userspace
 *	will be taken from the TX status instead of the rate control

 *	Some wireless LAN chipsets buffer broadcast/multicast frames
 *	for power saving stations in the hardware/firmware and others
 *	rely on the host system for such buffering. This option is used
 *	to configure the IEEE 802.11 upper layer to buffer broadcast and

 *	If possible please provide dB or dBm instead.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SIGNAL_DBM:
 *	Hardware gives signal values in dBm, decibel difference from

 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_DYNAMIC_SMPS:

 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_UAPSD:

 * @IEEE80211_HW_REPORTS_TX_ACK_STATUS:
 *	Hardware can provide ack status reports of Tx frames to
 *	the stack.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_CONNECTION_MONITOR:
 *      The hardware performs its own connection monitoring, including
 *      periodic keep-alives to the AP and probing the AP on beacon loss.
 *      When this flag is set, signaling beacon-loss will cause an immediate
 *      change to disassociated state.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_CQM_RSSI:

 *	provide notifications if configured trigger levels are reached.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_NEED_DTIM_PERIOD:
 *	This device needs to know the DTIM period for the BSS before
 *	associating.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PER_STA_GTK: The device's crypto engine supports
 *	per-station GTKs as used by IBSS RSN or during fast transition. If
 *	the device doesn't support per-station GTKs, but can be asked not
 *	to decrypt group addressed frames, then IBSS RSN support is still
 *	possible but software crypto will be used. Advertise the wiphy flag
 *	only in that case.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_AP_LINK_PS: When operating in AP mode the device
 *	autonomously manages the PS status of connected stations. When
 *	this flag is set mac80211 will not trigger PS mode for connected
 *	stations based on the PM bit of incoming frames.
 *	Use ieee80211_start_ps()/ieee8021_end_ps() to manually configure
 *	the PS mode of connected stations.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_TX_AMPDU_SETUP_IN_HW: The device handles TX A-MPDU session
 *      setup strictly in HW. mac80211 should not attempt to do this in
 *      software.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_CQM_BEACON_MISS
 *      Connection quality monitoring - beacon miss.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_CQM_TX_FAIL

 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_MULTI_CHANNEL
 *      Hardware supports simultaneous operation on different channels.
 *
 * @IEEE80211_HW_QUEUE_CONTROL: The driver wants to control per-interface

/**
 * DOC: Hardware crypto acceleration
 *
 * mac80211 is capable of taking advantage of many hardware
 * acceleration designs for encryption and decryption operations.
 *
 * The set_key() callback in the &struct ieee80211_ops for a given
 * device is called to enable hardware acceleration of encryption and
 * decryption. The callback takes a @sta parameter that will be NULL
 * for default keys or keys used for transmission only, or point to
 * the station information for the peer for individual keys.
 * Multiple transmission keys with the same key index may be used when
 * VLANs are configured for an access point.
 *
 * When transmitting, the TX control data will use the @hw_key_idx
 * selected by the driver by modifying the &struct ieee80211_key_conf
 * pointed to by the @key parameter to the set_key() function.
 *
 * The set_key() call for the %SET_KEY command should return 0 if
 * the key is now in use, -%EOPNOTSUPP or -%ENOSPC if it couldn't be
 * added; if you return 0 then hw_key_idx must be assigned to the
 * hardware key index, you are free to use the full u8 range.
 *
 * When the cmd is %DISABLE_KEY then it must succeed.
 *
 * Note that it is permissible to not decrypt a frame even if a key
 * for it has been uploaded to hardware, the stack will not make any
 * decision based on whether a key has been uploaded or not but rather
 * based on the receive flags.
 *
 * The &struct ieee80211_key_conf structure pointed to by the @key
 * parameter is guaranteed to be valid until another call to set_key()
 * removes it, but it can only be used as a cookie to differentiate
 * keys.
 *
 * In TKIP some HW need to be provided a phase 1 key, for RX decryption
 * acceleration (i.e. iwlwifi). Those drivers should provide update_tkip_key
 * handler.
 * The update_tkip_key() call updates the driver with the new phase 1 key.
 * This happens every time the iv16 wraps around (every 65536 packets). The
 * set_key() call will happen only once for each key (unless the AP did
 * rekeying), it will not include a valid phase 1 key. The valid phase 1 key is
 * provided by update_tkip_key only. The trigger that makes mac80211 call this
 * handler is software decryption with wrap around of iv16.

/**
 * DOC: Powersave support
 *
 * mac80211 has support for various powersave implementations.
 *
 * First, it can support hardware that handles all powersaving by itself,
 * such hardware should simply set the %IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PS hardware
 * flag. In that case, it will be told about the desired powersave mode
 * with the %IEEE80211_CONF_PS flag depending on the association status.
 * The hardware must take care of sending nullfunc frames when necessary,
 * i.e. when entering and leaving powersave mode. The hardware is required
 * to look at the AID in beacons and signal to the AP that it woke up when
 * it finds traffic directed to it.
 *
 * %IEEE80211_CONF_PS flag enabled means that the powersave mode defined in
 * IEEE 802.11-2007 section 11.2 is enabled. This is not to be confused
 * with hardware wakeup and sleep states. Driver is responsible for waking
 * up the hardware before issuing commands to the hardware and putting it
 * back to sleep at appropriate times.
 *
 * When PS is enabled, hardware needs to wakeup for beacons and receive the
 * buffered multicast/broadcast frames after the beacon. Also it must be
 * possible to send frames and receive the acknowledment frame.
 *
 * Other hardware designs cannot send nullfunc frames by themselves and also
 * need software support for parsing the TIM bitmap. This is also supported
 * by mac80211 by combining the %IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PS and
 * %IEEE80211_HW_PS_NULLFUNC_STACK flags. The hardware is of course still
 * required to pass up beacons. The hardware is still required to handle
 * waking up for multicast traffic; if it cannot the driver must handle that
 * as best as it can, mac80211 is too slow to do that.
 *
 * Dynamic powersave is an extension to normal powersave in which the
 * hardware stays awake for a user-specified period of time after sending a
 * frame so that reply frames need not be buffered and therefore delayed to
 * the next wakeup. It's compromise of getting good enough latency when
 * there's data traffic and still saving significantly power in idle
 * periods.
 *
 * Dynamic powersave is simply supported by mac80211 enabling and disabling
 * PS based on traffic. Driver needs to only set %IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_PS
 * flag and mac80211 will handle everything automatically. Additionally,
 * hardware having support for the dynamic PS feature may set the
 * %IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_DYNAMIC_PS flag to indicate that it can support
 * dynamic PS mode itself. The driver needs to look at the
 * @dynamic_ps_timeout hardware configuration value and use it that value
 * whenever %IEEE80211_CONF_PS is set. In this case mac80211 will disable
 * dynamic PS feature in stack and will just keep %IEEE80211_CONF_PS
 * enabled whenever user has enabled powersave.
 *
 * Some hardware need to toggle a single shared antenna between WLAN and
 * Bluetooth to facilitate co-existence. These types of hardware set
 * limitations on the use of host controlled dynamic powersave whenever there
 * is simultaneous WLAN and Bluetooth traffic. For these types of hardware, the
 * driver may request temporarily going into full power save, in order to
 * enable toggling the antenna between BT and WLAN. If the driver requests
 * disabling dynamic powersave, the @dynamic_ps_timeout value will be
 * temporarily set to zero until the driver re-enables dynamic powersave.
 *
 * Driver informs U-APSD client support by enabling
 * %IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_UAPSD flag. The mode is configured through the
 * uapsd paramater in conf_tx() operation. Hardware needs to send the QoS
 * Nullfunc frames and stay awake until the service period has ended. To
 * utilize U-APSD, dynamic powersave is disabled for voip AC and all frames
 * from that AC are transmitted with powersave enabled.
 *
 * Note: U-APSD client mode is not yet supported with
 * %IEEE80211_HW_PS_NULLFUNC_STACK.

/**
 * DOC: Beacon filter support
 *
 * Some hardware have beacon filter support to reduce host cpu wakeups
 * which will reduce system power consumption. It usuallly works so that
 * the firmware creates a checksum of the beacon but omits all constantly
 * changing elements (TSF, TIM etc). Whenever the checksum changes the
 * beacon is forwarded to the host, otherwise it will be just dropped. That
 * way the host will only receive beacons where some relevant information
 * (for example ERP protection or WMM settings) have changed.
 *
 * Beacon filter support is advertised with the %IEEE80211_HW_BEACON_FILTER
 * hardware capability. The driver needs to enable beacon filter support
 * whenever power save is enabled, that is %IEEE80211_CONF_PS is set. When
 * power save is enabled, the stack will not check for beacon loss and the
 * driver needs to notify about loss of beacons with ieee80211_beacon_loss().
 *
 * The time (or number of beacons missed) until the firmware notifies the
 * driver of a beacon loss event (which in turn causes the driver to call
 * ieee80211_beacon_loss()) should be configurable and will be controlled
 * by mac80211 and the roaming algorithm in the future.
 *
 * Since there may be constantly changing information elements that nothing
 * in the software stack cares about, we will, in the future, have mac80211
 * tell the driver which information elements are interesting in the sense
 * that we want to see changes in them. This will include
 *  - a list of information element IDs
 *  - a list of OUIs for the vendor information element
 *
 * Ideally, the hardware would filter out any beacons without changes in the
 * requested elements, but if it cannot support that it may, at the expense
 * of some efficiency, filter out only a subset. For example, if the device
 * doesn't support checking for OUIs it should pass up all changes in all
 * vendor information elements.
 *
 * Note that change, for the sake of simplification, also includes information
 * elements appearing or disappearing from the beacon.
 *
 * Some hardware supports an "ignore list" instead, just make sure nothing
 * that was requested is on the ignore list, and include commonly changing
 * information element IDs in the ignore list, for example 11 (BSS load) and
 * the various vendor-assigned IEs with unknown contents (128, 129, 133-136,
 * 149, 150, 155, 156, 173, 176, 178, 179, 219); for forward compatibility
 * it could also include some currently unused IDs.
 *
 *
 * In addition to these capabilities, hardware should support notifying the
 * host of changes in the beacon RSSI. This is relevant to implement roaming
 * when no traffic is flowing (when traffic is flowing we see the RSSI of
 * the received data packets). This can consist in notifying the host when
 * the RSSI changes significantly or when it drops below or rises above
 * configurable thresholds. In the future these thresholds will also be
 * configured by mac80211 (which gets them from userspace) to implement
 * them as the roaming algorithm requires.
 *
 * If the hardware cannot implement this, the driver should ask it to
 * periodically pass beacon frames to the host so that software can do the
 * signal strength threshold checking.

/**
 * DOC: Spatial multiplexing power save
 *
 * SMPS (Spatial multiplexing power save) is a mechanism to conserve
 * power in an 802.11n implementation. For details on the mechanism
 * and rationale, please refer to 802.11 (as amended by 802.11n-2009)
 * "11.2.3 SM power save".
 *
 * The mac80211 implementation is capable of sending action frames
 * to update the AP about the station's SMPS mode, and will instruct
 * the driver to enter the specific mode. It will also announce the
 * requested SMPS mode during the association handshake. Hardware
 * support for this feature is required, and can be indicated by
 * hardware flags.
 *
 * The default mode will be "automatic", which nl80211/cfg80211
 * defines to be dynamic SMPS in (regular) powersave, and SMPS
 * turned off otherwise.
 *
 * To support this feature, the driver must set the appropriate
 * hardware support flags, and handle the SMPS flag to the config()
 * operation. It will then with this mechanism be instructed to
 * enter the requested SMPS mode while associated to an HT AP.

/**
 * DOC: Frame filtering
 *
 * mac80211 requires to see many management frames for proper
 * operation, and users may want to see many more frames when
 * in monitor mode. However, for best CPU usage and power consumption,
 * having as few frames as possible percolate through the stack is
 * desirable. Hence, the hardware should filter as much as possible.
 *
 * To achieve this, mac80211 uses filter flags (see below) to tell
 * the driver's configure_filter() function which frames should be
 * passed to mac80211 and which should be filtered out.
 *
 * Before configure_filter() is invoked, the prepare_multicast()
 * callback is invoked with the parameters @mc_count and @mc_list
 * for the combined multicast address list of all virtual interfaces.
 * It's use is optional, and it returns a u64 that is passed to
 * configure_filter(). Additionally, configure_filter() has the
 * arguments @changed_flags telling which flags were changed and
 * @total_flags with the new flag states.
 *
 * If your device has no multicast address filters your driver will
 * need to check both the %FIF_ALLMULTI flag and the @mc_count
 * parameter to see whether multicast frames should be accepted
 * or dropped.
 *
 * All unsupported flags in @total_flags must be cleared.
 * Hardware does not support a flag if it is incapable of _passing_
 * the frame to the stack. Otherwise the driver must ignore
 * the flag, but not clear it.
 * You must _only_ clear the flag (announce no support for the
 * flag to mac80211) if you are not able to pass the packet type
 * to the stack (so the hardware always filters it).
 * So for example, you should clear @FIF_CONTROL, if your hardware
 * always filters control frames. If your hardware always passes
 * control frames to the kernel and is incapable of filtering them,
 * you do _not_ clear the @FIF_CONTROL flag.
 * This rule applies to all other FIF flags as well.

/**
 * DOC: AP support for powersaving clients
 *
 * In order to implement AP and P2P GO modes, mac80211 has support for
 * client powersaving, both "legacy" PS (PS-Poll/null data) and uAPSD.
 * There currently is no support for sAPSD.
 *
 * There is one assumption that mac80211 makes, namely that a client
 * will not poll with PS-Poll and trigger with uAPSD at the same time.
 * Both are supported, and both can be used by the same client, but
 * they can't be used concurrently by the same client. This simplifies
 * the driver code.
 *
 * The first thing to keep in mind is that there is a flag for complete
 * driver implementation: %IEEE80211_HW_AP_LINK_PS. If this flag is set,
 * mac80211 expects the driver to handle most of the state machine for
 * powersaving clients and will ignore the PM bit in incoming frames.
 * Drivers then use ieee80211_sta_ps_transition() to inform mac80211 of
 * stations' powersave transitions. In this mode, mac80211 also doesn't
 * handle PS-Poll/uAPSD.
 *
 * In the mode without %IEEE80211_HW_AP_LINK_PS, mac80211 will check the
 * PM bit in incoming frames for client powersave transitions. When a
 * station goes to sleep, we will stop transmitting to it. There is,
 * however, a race condition: a station might go to sleep while there is
 * data buffered on hardware queues. If the device has support for this
 * it will reject frames, and the driver should give the frames back to
 * mac80211 with the %IEEE80211_TX_STAT_TX_FILTERED flag set which will
 * cause mac80211 to retry the frame when the station wakes up. The
 * driver is also notified of powersave transitions by calling its
 * @sta_notify callback.
 *
 * When the station is asleep, it has three choices: it can wake up,
 * it can PS-Poll, or it can possibly start a uAPSD service period.
 * Waking up is implemented by simply transmitting all buffered (and
 * filtered) frames to the station. This is the easiest case. When
 * the station sends a PS-Poll or a uAPSD trigger frame, mac80211
 * will inform the driver of this with the @allow_buffered_frames
 * callback; this callback is optional. mac80211 will then transmit
 * the frames as usual and set the %IEEE80211_TX_CTL_POLL_RESPONSE
 * on each frame. The last frame in the service period (or the only
 * response to a PS-Poll) also has %IEEE80211_TX_STATUS_EOSP set to
 * indicate that it ends the service period; as this frame must have
 * TX status report it also sets %IEEE80211_TX_CTL_REQ_TX_STATUS.
 * When TX status is reported for this frame, the service period is
 * marked has having ended and a new one can be started by the peer.
 *
 * Another race condition can happen on some devices like iwlwifi
 * when there are frames queued for the station and it wakes up
 * or polls; the frames that are already queued could end up being
 * transmitted first instead, causing reordering and/or wrong
 * processing of the EOSP. The cause is that allowing frames to be
 * transmitted to a certain station is out-of-band communication to
 * the device. To allow this problem to be solved, the driver can
 * call ieee80211_sta_block_awake() if frames are buffered when it
 * is notified that the station went to sleep. When all these frames
 * have been filtered (see above), it must call the function again
 * to indicate that the station is no longer blocked.
 *
 * If the driver buffers frames in the driver for aggregation in any
 * way, it must use the ieee80211_sta_set_buffered() call when it is
 * notified of the station going to sleep to inform mac80211 of any
 * TIDs that have frames buffered. Note that when a station wakes up
 * this information is reset (hence the requirement to call it when
 * informed of the station going to sleep). Then, when a service
 * period starts for any reason, @release_buffered_frames is called
 * with the number of frames to be released and which TIDs they are
 * to come from. In this case, the driver is responsible for setting
 * the EOSP (for uAPSD) and MORE_DATA bits in the released frames,
 * to help the @more_data paramter is passed to tell the driver if
 * there is more data on other TIDs -- the TIDs to release frames
 * from are ignored since mac80211 doesn't know how many frames the
 * buffers for those TIDs contain.
 *
 * If the driver also implement GO mode, where absence periods may
 * shorten service periods (or abort PS-Poll responses), it must
 * filter those response frames except in the case of frames that
 * are buffered in the driver -- those must remain buffered to avoid
 * reordering. Because it is possible that no frames are released
 * in this case, the driver must call ieee80211_sta_eosp_irqsafe()
 * to indicate to mac80211 that the service period ended anyway.
 *
 * Finally, if frames from multiple TIDs are released from mac80211
 * but the driver might reorder them, it must clear & set the flags
 * appropriately (only the last frame may have %IEEE80211_TX_STATUS_EOSP)
 * and also take care of the EOSP and MORE_DATA bits in the frame.
 * The driver may also use ieee80211_sta_eosp_irqsafe() in this case.

/**
 * DOC: HW queue control
 *
 * Before HW queue control was introduced, mac80211 only had a single static
 * assignment of per-interface AC software queues to hardware queues. This
 * was problematic for a few reasons:
 * 1) off-channel transmissions might get stuck behind other frames
 * 2) multiple virtual interfaces couldn't be handled correctly
 * 3) after-DTIM frames could get stuck behind other frames
 *
 * To solve this, hardware typically uses multiple different queues for all
 * the different usages, and this needs to be propagated into mac80211 so it
 * won't have the same problem with the software queues.
 *
 * Therefore, mac80211 now offers the %IEEE80211_HW_QUEUE_CONTROL capability
 * flag that tells it that the driver implements its own queue control. To do
 * so, the driver will set up the various queues in each &struct ieee80211_vif
 * and the offchannel queue in &struct ieee80211_hw. In response, mac80211 will
 * use those queue IDs in the hw_queue field of &struct ieee80211_tx_info and
 * if necessary will queue the frame on the right software queue that mirrors
 * the hardware queue.
 * Additionally, the driver has to then use these HW queue IDs for the queue
 * management functions (ieee80211_stop_queue() et al.)
 *
 * The driver is free to set up the queue mappings as needed, multiple virtual
 * interfaces may map to the same hardware queues if needed. The setup has to
 * happen during add_interface or change_interface callbacks. For example, a
 * driver supporting station+station and station+AP modes might decide to have
 * 10 hardware queues to handle different scenarios:
 *
 * 4 AC HW queues for 1st vif: 0, 1, 2, 3
 * 4 AC HW queues for 2nd vif: 4, 5, 6, 7
 * after-DTIM queue for AP:   8
 * off-channel queue:         9
 *
 * It would then set up the hardware like this:
 *   hw.offchannel_tx_hw_queue = 9
 *
 * and the first virtual interface that is added as follows:
 *   vif.hw_queue[IEEE80211_AC_VO] = 0
 *   vif.hw_queue[IEEE80211_AC_VI] = 1
 *   vif.hw_queue[IEEE80211_AC_BE] = 2
 *   vif.hw_queue[IEEE80211_AC_BK] = 3
 *   vif.cab_queue = 8 // if AP mode, otherwise %IEEE80211_INVAL_HW_QUEUE
 * and the second virtual interface with 4-7.
 *
 * If queue 6 gets full, for example, mac80211 would only stop the second
 * virtual interface's BE queue since virtual interface queues are per AC.
 *
 * Note that the vif.cab_queue value should be set to %IEEE80211_INVAL_HW_QUEUE
 * whenever the queue is not used (i.e. the interface is not in AP mode) if the
 * queue could potentially be shared since mac80211 will look at cab_queue when
 * a queue is stopped/woken even if the interface is not in AP mode.
